This repository contains a program that will solve dimensionles differential equations to describe the radial mass distrubution inside a white dwarf star where;

the central mass distrubtion is initally 10. 

In particular, this program is completely controlled by the makefile. 

After running the script, the result shows how the density changes as the radius increases, and it comes out as expected. 

The graph of the results are shown below.
